# Setting Up

First things first, we include the module into the project.

```js
const Birthdays = require("discord-birthday-wisher");
```

After that, you need to provide a valid mongo database url, and set it. You can do so by:

See How to connect to MongoDB Atlas [here](https://studio3t.com/knowledge-base/articles/connect-to-mongodb-atlas/)

```js
Birthdays.connectionURL("mongodb://..."); // You only need to do this ONCE per process.
```

# Examples

_Examples can be found in /test_

# How it works

## setBirthday

1. First, it runs a check to validated the given parameters.
2. Then, it creates a MongoDB document in your database that stores the information.
3. After that, it uses [node-schedule](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule) to schedule a job at the specified birthday date.
4. Lastly, when we get to that date, it sends a message to the specified channel wishing the user a happy birthday.

## deleteBirthday

1. First, it runs a check to validated the given parameters.
2. Then, it finds the MongoDB document that matches with the inforamtion and deletes this document.
3. Lastly, it retrieves the [node-schedule](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule) job and cancels it.

## changeBirthday

1. First, it runs a check to validated the given parameters.
2. Then, it finds the MongoDB document that matches with the inforamtion and updates this document.
3. Lastly, it retrieves the [node-schedule](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule) job and updates it with the new date.
